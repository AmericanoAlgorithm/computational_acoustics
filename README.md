# Computational Acoustics

This repository contains a (hopefully growing) collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks illustrating various techniques in computational acoustics. So far we have


## Finite Element Method (FEM)

* Solution of the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation with Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions ([view it on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spatialaudio/computational_acoustics/blob/master/FEM_Helmholtz_equation_2D.ipynb))
* (Time-domain) Solution of the two-dimensional wave equation ([view it on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spatialaudio/computational_acoustics/blob/master/FEM_wave_equation_2D.ipynb))
* Solution of the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation with Robin boundary conditions ([view it on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spatialaudio/computational_acoustics/blob/master/FEM_Helmholtz_equation_2D_Robin.ipynb))
* Some example meshes ([view it on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spatialaudio/computational_acoustics/blob/master/FEM_example_meshes_2D.ipynb))
