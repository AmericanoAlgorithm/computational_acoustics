    "This notebook illustrates the numerical time-domain solution of the wave equation using the [Finite Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) (FEM). The method aims at an approximate solution by subdividing the area of interest into smaller parts with simpler geometry, linking these parts together and applying methods from the calculus of variations to solve the problem numerically. The FEM is a well established method for the numerical approximation of the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The solutions of PDEs are often known analytically only for rather simple geometries. FEM based simulations allow to gain insights into other more complex cases."
